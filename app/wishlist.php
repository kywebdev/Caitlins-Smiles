					<p>In addition to volunteering, supporters of Caitlin’s Smiles can help by making donations of supplies. To make it easier for you, we’ve compiled a ‘Wish List’ on Amazon. By purchasing from Amazon and having your donations shipped directly to our location, you save yourself the time and won’t have to worry about lifting or delivering heavy items. Make sure you choose to include your name and address information in the order so we are aware who the donation is from. Often, we receive donations through Amazon with no donor information included.</p>
					<h3>Ship directly to Caitlin's Smiles:<br />3303 N. 6th Street, Harrisburg, PA 17110</h3>
					<p>As well as purchasing items on Amazon, supporters can choose Caitlin’s Smiles as their charity of choice on AmazonSmile. AmazonSmile is the same Amazon you know, with the same products, same prices, and same service. However, when you shop through AmazonSmile, Amazon donates 0.5 percent of the price of your eligible purchases to Caitlin’s Smiles. To get tarted, visit <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">amazon.com</a> and choose Caitlin’s Smiles as your charity of choice. This works with Amazon Prime, too!</p>
