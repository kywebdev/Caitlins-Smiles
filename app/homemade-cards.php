								<p><strong>When making cards, please keep in mind the following:</strong><br />
								Cards may be any size and shape.<br />
								Card stock or constructions paper may be used.</p>
								<p><strong>Do not say get well soon.</strong> Many of the children are facing terminal or chronic conditions and may not get well, rather they learn to live with their condition.</p>
								<p><strong>Do not include any type of religious message.</strong><br />
								Our program reaches children of many different religious backgrounds.</p>
								<p><strong>Focus on sayings such as:</strong><br />
								Sending Smiles (Smiley face theme)<br />
								Sending Bear Hugs (bear cut out card)<br />
								Thinking of You<br />
								Sending Warm Wishes<br />
								You're a Star (shooting stars)<br />
								You're a Champion (sports drawing)</p>
								<p><strong>Children love bright, bold and silly cards. Jokes, riddles and funny sayings are great to include.</strong></p>
