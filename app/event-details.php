					<p>This year, our auction theme is "ART IS ESSENTIAL." This theme focuses on how the process of creating art can help us cope wherever we may find ourselves, whether it be in a hospital room during an illness or injury, or at home during a worldwide pandemic. Recent events help us to understand that art can serve as a stress reliever and coping mechanism, not only for the incredible children we serve but for all of us. Online Bidding for this event will begin at Noon on Sunday, November 1st and will run an entire week. Online Bidding will close one week later at Noon on Sunday, November 8th. In order to bid, you must register for a ticket. We have both complimentary (free) and VIP ($20) tickets available. Several sponsorship levels are also available. The ticket link will be open on October 7th. We will add that information to this page at that time. See more details about each ticket and sponsorship levels below.</p>
					<p>Our featured event of the weeklong auction will be a live program taking place on Saturday, November 7th at 7 p.m. here on Facebook. This event will feature our host Sharia Benn, founder of Sankofa African American Theatre Company, along with Caitlin's Smiles founder and director, Cheryl Hornung, plus other special guests.
